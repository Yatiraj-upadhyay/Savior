# Saviour
Integrating cross-border architecture detection and corresponding inventory updates into the realm of global defense.
# Aim
The project aims to address security concerns near borders by improving communication protocols to efficiently manage and respond to suspicious architecture and movement. Current protocols often cause delays in taking appropriate actions, risking security breaches. The goal is to develop a solution that minimizes communication time, allowing for swift and effective response to potential threats.

# Cross-Border Architecture Detection and Inventory Updates
# Overview
This project aims to integrate cross-border architecture detection with real-time inventory updates to enhance global defense capabilities. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Firebase, OpenCV, React.js, and MongoDB Atlas, we provide a comprehensive solution for monitoring and managing defense assets across borders.
